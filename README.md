|  Account | Used to provide personalized access to a user. An account may be associated with a) one or more identities b) one or more purchases associated c) one or more devices. |  |
|  Account attribute |  |  |
|  API (Application Programming Interface) | An application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.  |  |
|  API Key | An application programming interface key (API key) is a code passed in by computer programs calling an application programming interface (API) to identify the calling program, its developer, or its user to the Web site. API keys are used to track and control how the API is being used, for example to prevent malicious use or abuse of the API as defined by terms of service. |  |
|  App | An application installed (or running) on a device. |  |
|  Authentication | The act of verifying the identity of a user or process e.g. Alice provides her email and password to identify herself. |  |
|  Authorization | The act of confirming if an authenticated user or process is permitted to access a resource. |  |
|  AWS (Amazon Web Services) | Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.  |  |
|  Binary | A binary file is a file whose content must be interpreted by a program or a hardware processor that understands in advance exactly how it is formatted. That is, the file is not in any externally identifiable format so that any program that wanted to could look for certain data at a certain place within the file. A progam (or hardware processor) has to know exactly how the data inside the file is laid out to make use of the file. In general, executable (ready-to-run) programs are often identified as binary files and given a file name extension of ".bin".  |  |
|  Bootstrap | A technique of loading a program into a computer by means of a few initial instructions that enable the introduction of the rest of the program from an input device. |  |
|  CMS (Content Management System) | A content management system (CMS) is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. |  |
|  DAI? | Got this from Joe's pitch deck |  |
|  DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) | Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), also known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers. Similar to Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) solution, MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments, each segment containing a short interval of playback time of content that is potentially many hours in duration, such as a movie or the live broadcast of a sports event. |  |
|  Device | A device that a user has access to. |  |
|  DRM (Digital Rights Management) | Digital rights management (DRM) is a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies. |  |
|  Environment | In computer program and software product development, the development environment is the set of processes and programming tools used to create the program or software product. The term may sometimes also imply the physical environment. An integrated development environment is one in which the processes and tools are coordinated to provide developers an orderly interface to and convenient view of the development process (or at least the processes of writing code, testing it, and packaging it for use).  |  |
|  EPG (Electronic Programming Guide) | Electronic program guides (EPGs) and interactive program guides (IPGs) are menu-based systems that provide users of television, radio and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying broadcast programming (TV listings in the UK) or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming. Some guides also feature backward scrolling to promote their catch up content. They are commonly known as guides or TV guides. |  |
|  Event | In computing, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the system, by the user or in other ways. Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow, that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an event loop. A source of events includes the user, who may interact with the software by way of, for example, keystrokes on the keyboard. Another source is a hardware device such as a timer. Software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop, e.g. to communicate the completion of a task. Software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event-driven, often with the goal of being interactive. |  |
|  Exceptions | Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often changing the normal flow of program execution. It is provided by specialized programming language constructs, computer hardware mechanisms like interrupts or operating system IPC facilities like signals. |  |
|  Framework | In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications. A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions.  |  |
|  GraphQL |  |  |
|  HLS (HTTP Live Stremaing) | HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS) is an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of its QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. It resembles MPEG-DASH in that it works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream.  |  |
|  HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. |  |
|  HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) | HTTPS (also called HTTP over Transport Layer Security [TLS],[1] HTTP over SSL,[2] and HTTP Secure[3][4]) is a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network which is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS consists of communication over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security, or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data. |  |
|  Identity | Data that an identity provider maintains about a user e.g. A user's name is Alice and her email is alice@google.com. |  |
|  Identity Providers | A service or platform that provides identity data e.g. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Adobe or MLBAM. |  |
|  Linking | The process of associating a) an identity from one or more provider to an account b) a purchase from one or more store to an account c) a device to an account or d) a device to purchase. Perhaps this is overloaded? Some linking is implicit, some explicit. |  |
|  Live | Written : In terms of digital streaming services and EPG's, live can have many meanings. Needs work. |  |
|  Login | Verb - The act of a user proving their identity to a provider with credentials. Noun - The credentials used by a user to prove their identity. |  |
|  Login Providers | See Identity Providers. |  |
|  M3U8 | M3U is a computer file format for a multimedia playlist. One common use of the M3U file format is creating a single-entry playlist file pointing to a stream on the Internet. The created file provides easy access to that stream and is often used in downloads from a website, for emailing, and for listening to Internet radio. The 8 denotes UTF-8 encoding.  |  |
|  Multi DRM | ?? |  |
|  MVPD (Multi Video Programming Distributor) | In the United States, a multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) is a service provider that delivers video programming services over more than one channel, usually for a subscription fee. These operators include direct-broadcast satellite providers, cable television systems, and various other wireline video providers (including Verizon FiOS as well as AT&T U-verse), and competitive local exchange carriers using internet protocol television. |  |
|  Object | In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and referenced by an identifier. In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, "object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person). |  |
|  Platform | The platform of a device e.g. iOS, Android, Chrome, Windows, Linux etc. |  |
|  Profile | User-selectable "persona", used to provide fine-grained personalization and customization for a specific user, rather than relying on the Device or Account - which may have many users within a household. For example - personal viewing recommendations, parental controls, etc. |  |
|  Purchase | A purchase made from a store (a purchase is not an identity). |  |
|  Receipt | Proof from a store that a purchase has taken place (a receipt is not an identity). |  |
|  Repo / repository | Written : In software engineering and development, a repository is a place where the core code files of an application are stored and shared with multiple developers. These files are stored and managed in a way that these developers can work on the same code base simultaneously with minimal conflicts.  |  |
|  Schema | The database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases).  |  |
|  Session | A session refers to a set of user interactions on an app for some given time period. |  |
|  Store | A store where purchases can be made e.g. iTunes, Play Store etc. |  |
|  Subscription | A subscription represents entitlements granted to an Account or Device, often the result of a purchase, with an optional expiration. |  |
|  UML | The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. |  |
|  User Profile | A user profile is a visual display of personal data associated with a specific user, or a customized desktop environment. A profile refers therefore to the explicit digital representation of a person's identity. A user profile can also be considered as the computer representation of a user model. |  |
|  UTF-8 | UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes] The encoding is defined by the Unicode standard, and was originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. The name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format – 8-bit. |  |
|  VOD (Video On Demand) | Video on demand (VOD) are systems which allow users to select and watch/listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows when they choose to, rather than having to watch at a specific broadcast time, which was the prevalent approach with over-the-air broadcasting during much of the 20th century. IPTV technology is often used to bring video on demand to televisions and personal computers. |  |
